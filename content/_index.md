Hello and welcome!
I'm Trang Le.
I'm a postdoctoral fellow with Jason Moore at the [Computational Genetics Lab](http://epistasis.org/), University of Pennsylvania.
I enjoy developing machine learning methods for analyses of biomedical data, including *neuroimage (functional/structural MRI)*, *transcriptomics* and *genotypes*.
Most of the datasets I work with are high dimensional (*i.e.*, have many predictors/features), so I spend most of my time building feature selection algorithms for these data.
I trade my bias toward the nearest-neighbor concept for lower variance of my methods and better generalizability.
When I'm not knee deep in data, I run, dance and seasonally ski.
